## Overview of the analysis
### The purpose of this analysis is to look at the weather conditions in Hawaii and compare the months of June and December

## Results
- There are 183 additional data points for June compared to December
- The June max temp is only 2 degrees higher than December
- The December min temp is 8 degrees lower than the June min temp

## Summary
### To gather more data and have a more complete analysis, I would recommend including the additional queries:
- Include preciptitation to see if there are differences in rain during these two months
- Look at weather patterns throughout the entire year to understand how much fluctuation in temperature there is
